# ISBNFriend Android

This is the Android version of my iOS App [ISBN Friend](https://github.com/MrRobertTheSmith/ISBN-Friend).

It queries the Google Books API using **RefroFit2** using either a text string entered in the main activity or a barcode detected from the camera using Google's **Mobile Vision API**.

The app also demonstrates using Android Architecture Components such as **ViewModel**, **LiveData**, Creates a modular view using Fragments, and and follows both android specific best practices as well as the same kind of design principles such as separation of concerns and reusability that apply accross platforms.
